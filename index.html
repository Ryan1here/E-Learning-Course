                Be it any web application or website, mobile app, the parts that
                are visible to the naked eye is the front end. As the user
                directly interacts with the front-end portion, the focus will be
                on improving the aesthetic and keeping the user experience easy

              <h2>Languages:</h2>
              <p>
                Some of the most common language that are used for front end
                development are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h3>HTML:</h3>
                  <p>
                    One of the basic expectations from an aspiring developer as
                    well is the knowledge of HTML. HTML is the abbreviation for
                    Hyper Text Markup Language.A front end language used to
                    design the front end portion of web pages using markup
                    language. HTML combines and gives the best of Hypertext and
                    Markup language. The markup language is used to define the
                    text documentation within tag which defines the structure of
                    web pages. On the other hand, Hypertext defines the link
                    between the web pages
                  </p>
                </li>

                  <p>
                    One of the popular front end languages is the CSS(Cascading
                    Style Sheets). The objectivity behind the language for
                    simplifying the process of making web pages presentable. CSS
                    allows you to apply styles to web pages and provides the
                    freedom to do this independent of the HTML.

                  <p>
                    The clear winner among the full stack developers as a front
                    end language is the heer simplicity JS brings along as you
                    shift between technologies. JavaScript enabled the
                    developers to provide an interactive experience for the
                    user. Enhancing the functionality of a website was where
                    Java script came out to be a winner among the front end
                    languages.

                  <p>
                    For people early into development, React is a declarative,
                    efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user
                    interfaces. One of the big reasons for increase in Demand
                    among Full Stack Developers is because the leading companies
                    across the globe are switching to React (Developed by
                    Facebook) from the traditional Angular(Developed by Google).

                While the front end development focuses on delivering the best
                experience to the user, the focus on back end or in other words
                server-side development will be on how the website works. Back

                This type of website mainly consists of three parts front end,
                back end, and database. The back end portion is often built
                using some libraries, frameworks, and languages such as:

                  <p>
                    Javascript’s dual ability in helping as Front end Language

                    Neither a framework, nor a programming language, Node.js is
                    an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for
                    executing JavaScript code outside of a browser.<br />
                    One of the common mistakes developers do in Full Stack
                    Developers do is to get confused and understand it’s a
                    framework or a programming language. The purpose of Node.js
                    is for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or
                    Mobile App and are also used in production by large
                    companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart and so on.
